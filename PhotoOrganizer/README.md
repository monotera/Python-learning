# Photo organizer
A program that runs by command line (shell) and receives 2 parameters as follows:
<pre><code>./photo_organizer.py -s path/of/the/source -d path/of/the/destination</pre></code> 
where the path of the source is a memory of a camera (i.e./run/media/gram/CANON_DC/252_CANON/)  
and the destination path a directory where I want to put my photos in an organized way
(i.e. / home / rnaranjo / Imagenes / Fotos).  
The program must take all the photos and videos in jpg, mp4 and avi format and must organize   
them within the destination path in an organized manner. for this you must create a directory
for each of the days you find the photos were taken (i.e. 
/home/rnaranjo/Imagenes/Photos/2014.11.12 for all the photos taken today) and additionally save 
a copy with a maximum height of 100 pixels in the form of a thumbnail, these photos must be in 
another folder called thumbs (i.e./home/rnaranjo/Imagenes/Photos/2014.11.12/thumbs)
